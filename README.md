# Calculate the Bill Division

Consider a scenario where a group of friends is having a meal at a restaurant. The total cost of the meal is divided equally among the friends. However, one of the friends did not order any item worth the amount that was paid. Your task is to write a Java program that calculates the amount that needs to be refunded to the friend who didn't share in the meal cost.

Write a program that takes the following input:
The number of items ordered (n)
The index of the item not consumed by the friend who didn't share the cost (k),
The cost of each item ordered (cost[i]),
The amount paid by each friend (b).
The program should output an integer representing the amount that needs to be refunded to the friend.

Examples:
Input:  4 1
	 3 10 2 9 
	 12
Output:  5
		 
Input:  4 1
